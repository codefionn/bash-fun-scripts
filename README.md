# bash-fun-scripts

This project contains some bash files, which were written to experience the joy of
solving simple problems with bash (and some tools of course) and to let of some
steam (with bash, ...).

## Required programs

bash (Bourne-Again shell), awk, curl, readlink
... well there's also a script, which checks for these programs anyway (check_req.sh)
